### ‚ö†Ô∏è Confidential & Proprietary Project

Due to the commercial nature of this startup and the proprietary algorithms involved, the source code for this repository is not public. This showcase is intended to detail the project's architecture, impact, and my specific contributions as a technical leader.

### üéØ The Problem

Users today have limited visibility and control over how their personal data is used by large tech platforms like Google and Meta. This lack of transparency can lead to social media addiction and a diminished sense of digital wellbeing, without clear, actionable ways for individuals to improve their habits.

### ‚ú® Our Solution

Haven is a privacy-first mobile application that empowers users to take back control. By ingesting and analyzing user-exported data from Google and Meta, Haven reverse-engineers engagement patterns and surfaces powerful, personalized insights. The app was built to help users understand their own digital addiction patterns and provide recommendations to foster healthier online habits. We successfully onboarded and gathered feedback from **50 alpha users** during our initial testing phase.
